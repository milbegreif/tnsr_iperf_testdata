# tnsr_iperf_testdata

Hi,

these are my results with TNSR and IPERF.


in the measurements folder you will find a folder called iperf and TNSR.


In the Iperf folder are basic measurements, here two servers were simply connected directly with a DA cable. Nothing else. one is a client and the other is a server. 


In the folder TNSR are the tests with the TNSR instances. Important are only the folders with the prefix V1_ to V6_ .

FEHLERHAFTE_MESSUNG and the backup folders are only for interested people.


I used three profiles. one with small, medium and large packages. 

the first one is for max PPS, the last one with the big packages for max throughput. 


You can find more details in the server_setup, server_start, client_setup and client_start scripts.
